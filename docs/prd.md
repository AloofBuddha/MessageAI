## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Build production-quality messaging infrastructure with real-time sync, offline support, and optimistic UI updates
- Pass 24-hour MVP gate with core messaging features (1-on-1 chat, group chat, read receipts, presence, push notifications)
- Implement AI-enhanced messaging features tailored to Remote Team Professional persona
- Deploy a working cross-platform application within 7 days
- Leverage modern AI capabilities (LLMs, function calling, RAG) to solve real user communication problems
- Create a messaging app that people would actually want to use every day

### Background Context

The MessageAI project aims to build WhatsApp-quality messaging infrastructure enhanced with modern AI capabilities. The original WhatsApp was built by just two developers in months and scaled to billions of users by solving fundamental challenges: message persistence, real-time delivery, optimistic UI updates, efficient data sync, and cross-platform compatibility.

This project challenges developers to replicate that core messaging infrastructure in one week while adding AI features that enhance the messaging experience—capabilities that didn't exist when WhatsApp launched. The result should be a production-grade real-time communication system with intelligent features (summarization, action extraction, smart search, decision tracking) that solve genuine pain points for distributed teams dealing with information overload and context switching.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application should feel as responsive and polished as WhatsApp—instant feedback for every action, smooth animations, and zero perceived lag. The core experience prioritizes speed and reliability over flashy features. AI capabilities should be integrated seamlessly without cluttering the messaging interface; users shouldn't feel like they're switching between "chat mode" and "AI mode."

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Optimistic UI First:** Every user action (sending message, reacting, etc.) shows immediate visual feedback before server confirmation
- **Contextual AI Access:** AI features accessible via long-press on messages, toolbar icons, or dedicated AI chat—not hidden in menus
- **Status Awareness:** Clear visual indicators for message states (sending → sent → delivered → read), online/offline status, and typing indicators
- **Offline Graceful Degradation:** When offline, UI clearly indicates queued messages without blocking user interaction

### Core Screens and Views

1. **Conversation List Screen** - Shows all conversations with latest message preview, unread counts, timestamps
2. **Chat Screen** - One-on-one or group conversation view with message bubbles, input field, media controls
3. **AI Assistant Interface** - Either dedicated chat with AI or contextual overlay for AI features
4. **Authentication Screen** - Email/password login and signup
5. **Profile/Settings Screen** - User profile, display name, profile picture, app settings
6. **Group Creation/Management** - Create new groups, add participants, view group info

### Accessibility

**Level:** None specified (basic platform defaults acceptable for MVP)

### Branding

**Style:** Clean, modern messaging app aesthetic similar to WhatsApp or Telegram. Focus on readability and speed over visual flair.

**Color Scheme:** Standard messaging app conventions—sent messages in accent color (blue/green), received messages in neutral gray, clear contrast for readability.

### Target Device and Platforms

**Platform:** React Native with Expo  
**Deployment:** Expo Go for testing, EAS Build for production deployment  
**Target Devices:** iOS and Android (via single React Native codebase)

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing:
- `/mobile` - React Native + Expo app
- `/functions` - Firebase Cloud Functions (for AI backend)

**Rationale:** Solo developer, easier to manage dependencies and deploy together.

### Platform & Mobile Stack

**Platform:** React Native with Expo  
**UI Framework:** React Native  
**Navigation:** Expo Router (file-based routing)  
**Local Storage:** Expo SQLite (offline-first persistence)  
**State Management:** Zustand  
**Notifications:** Expo Notifications + FCM  
**Language:** TypeScript throughout

**Rationale:** Developer is expert with React. React Native learning curve is minimal—mostly learning platform-specific APIs. Expo handles native configuration complexity.

### Backend & Real-Time Infrastructure

**Backend:** Firebase  
**Database:** Firestore (real-time NoSQL)  
**Authentication:** Firebase Auth (email/password)  
**Functions:** Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js, serverless)  
**Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) via Expo  
**Storage:** Firebase Storage (profile pictures, images)

**Rationale:** Firestore provides real-time sync out of the box, solving the hardest technical challenge. Cloud Functions keep API keys secure server-side.

### AI Integration

**LLM Provider:** OpenAI GPT-4  
**Agent Framework:** AI SDK by Vercel  
**Architecture:** Cloud Functions call OpenAI, mobile app calls Cloud Functions  
**RAG Pipeline:** Firestore conversation history → Cloud Function → OpenAI with context  
**Capabilities:** Function calling for structured outputs (action items, decisions, scheduling detection)

**Rationale:** GPT-4 is best-in-class for required AI features. AI SDK is TypeScript-first and handles streaming, function calling elegantly.

### Service Architecture

**Pattern:** Serverless functions within Monorepo  
**Real-time:** Firestore real-time listeners for message sync  
**Offline:** Expo SQLite as local cache, sync on reconnect  
**Message Flow:** Mobile app → Firestore (direct for messages) + Cloud Functions (for AI features)

**Rationale:** Serverless scales to zero cost. Firestore real-time listeners handle message delivery complexity. Local SQLite ensures offline functionality.

### Testing Requirements

**Approach:** Unit tests only for critical business logic  
**Tools:** Jest (included with Expo)  
**Coverage:** Message queuing logic, offline sync, AI parsing functions  

**Rationale:** 7-day timeline prioritizes working features over comprehensive test coverage. Manual testing on real devices for MVP validation.

### Additional Technical Assumptions

- **Development Environment:** Expo Go for rapid testing, EAS Build for final deployment
- **Styling:** React Native StyleSheet or NativeWind (Tailwind for RN)
- **Message Queue:** Local SQLite table for pending messages, sync when online
- **Environment Variables:** Expo SecureStore for sensitive tokens, .env for configuration
- **Error Handling:** Console logging for MVP, Sentry/Firebase Crashlytics post-MVP (optional)

**Architecture Details to Refine with Architect:**
- Firestore message data model (structure for real-time + groups)
- Optimistic UI implementation pattern
- Offline message queue sync strategy
- AI assistant UI approach (dedicated chat vs contextual buttons)

| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data model needs architect refinement |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | Document is clear and actionable |

### Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None

**HIGH:**
- Data model for Firestore (messages, conversations, users) needs detailed design by Architect
- Offline sync strategy needs algorithmic specification
- Push notification Cloud Function trigger needs implementation pattern

**MEDIUM:**
- Epic 2 and Epic 3 stories undefined (intentionally deferred until MVP complete)
- Success metrics for AI feature quality not specified (can be post-MVP)
- Security rules for Firestore need definition

**LOW:**
- Testing strategy is minimal (acceptable for 7-day timeline)
- No rollback/deployment strategy specified (acceptable for MVP)

### MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Evaluation:** Epic 1 is appropriately scoped as true MVP. All 11 stories deliver value toward the 24-hour gate requirements.

**Potential Scope Cuts (if timeline pressure):**
1. Story 1.10 (Profile Pictures & Media) - Could defer image messages to Day 2, keep only profile pics
2. Story 1.8 (Typing Indicators) - Nice-to-have, not in core MVP spec
3. Story 1.9 (Push Notifications) - Spec says "at least foreground" - could simplify to foreground-only

**Missing Essential Features:** None - All MessageAI MVP requirements (FR1-FR11) are covered in Epic 1.

**Complexity Concerns:**
- Story 1.5 (Offline Support) is the most technically complex - message queue sync logic
- Story 1.9 (Push Notifications) has Firebase/Expo integration complexity
- Story 1.11 (Testing) requires multi-device setup

**Timeline Realism:** 24 hours for 11 stories averages 2-2.5 hours per story. Realistic for experienced developer with React expertise, but requires:
- No scope creep
- Minimal debugging delays
- Fast Firebase setup
- Leveraging Expo defaults

### Technical Readiness

**Clarity of Technical Constraints:** ✅ Excellent
- React Native + Expo + Firebase stack fully specified
- TypeScript throughout
- Monorepo structure defined
- All dependencies identified

**Identified Technical Risks:**
1. **Offline sync complexity** - SQLite + Firestore bidirectional sync with conflict resolution
2. **Push notification setup** - FCM configuration across Expo + Firebase can be finicky
3. **Real-time listener performance** - Multiple Firestore listeners could impact battery/performance
4. **React Native learning curve** - Developer is React expert but RN beginner (mitigated by Expo)

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**
1. Firestore data model schema (collections structure, indexes, security rules)
2. Optimistic UI implementation pattern (local state + sync strategy)
3. Message queue algorithm (pending messages, retry logic, ordering guarantees)
4. AI assistant UI/UX approach (dedicated chat vs contextual)

### Recommendations

**For Immediate Action:**
1. ✅ PRD is ready - hand off to Architect agent to design data model and architecture
2. Set up Firebase project ASAP (do Story 1.1 setup manually if needed to unblock)
3. Keep Epic 2 & 3 stories flexible - will learn from Epic 1 execution

**For MVP Success:**
1. Start Story 1.1 immediately - project setup is your foundation
2. Budget 3 hours for Stories 1.5 (offline) and 1.9 (notifications) - they're complex
3. Story 1.11 (testing) is NOT optional - allocate 2 hours for multi-device testing
4. If you hit hour 20 without all features, invoke the scope cut list above

**For Post-MVP:**
1. Refine Epic 2 stories after MVP is complete (Day 2 morning)
2. Document learned lessons from Epic 1 to inform AI feature implementation
3. Consider adding Firestore security rules as first story of Epic 2

### Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The Architect should focus on:
1. Firestore data model design (collections, documents, indexes)
2. Offline-first architecture pattern
3. Message queue and sync algorithm
4. Cloud Functions structure for push notifications

Epic 1 provides clear acceptance criteria for all 11 stories. Developer can begin Story 1.1 immediately after architecture review.
