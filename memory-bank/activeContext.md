# Active Context

## Current Status
**Last Updated**: End of Story 1.5 (Offline Support)  
**Status**: ✅ Story 1.5 COMPLETED and fully tested

## Just Completed: Story 1.5 - Local Persistence & Offline Support

### What Was Built
1. **SQLite Database Infrastructure**
   - Migration system with version control
   - Four tables: users, conversations, messages, pending_messages
   - Repository pattern for clean data access

2. **Cache-First Loading**
   - Messages and conversations load instantly from SQLite
   - Firestore syncs in background
   - Cache exactly matches Firestore (replaceForConversation pattern)

3. **Network Monitoring**
   - Real-time network status detection
   - Checks both `isConnected` AND `isInternetReachable`
   - Offline indicator banner component

4. **Offline Message Queue**
   - Messages sent offline queue in SQLite
   - Automatic sync when connection restored
   - Survives app crashes (in production builds)

5. **Multi-line Chat Input**
   - Auto-expands from 1 to 5 lines
   - Scrolls when exceeds 5 lines
   - Shows most recent line by default

### Key Bugs Fixed During Implementation
1. Circular dependency between syncManager and messagesStore
2. Migration API updated from old WebSQL to new Expo SQLite
3. Cache sync fixed with replaceForConversation method
4. Network detection now checks both connection fields
5. Sync manager function call parameters corrected
6. Initialization race condition resolved with isDbInitialized state

### Testing Results
All 7 tests passed:
- ✅ SQLite initialization
- ✅ Cache-first loading
- ✅ Network status detection
- ✅ Offline message queueing
- ✅ Auto-sync on reconnect
- ✅ Conversations cache
- ✅ Network toggle stress test

### Code Cleanup
- Removed verbose cache/sync logs
- Kept important initialization and error logs
- Console output now clean and informative

## Current Grade: 45/100 (F)

**Target**: 90/100 (Grade A)  
**Gap**: +45 points needed

### Grade Breakdown
- **Section 1 (Messaging)**: 22/35 - Missing group chat (-11)
- **Section 2 (Mobile Quality)**: 13/20 - Missing push notifications (-4)
- **Section 3 (AI Features)**: 0/30 - **CRITICAL GAP**
- **Section 4 (Technical)**: 7/10 - Solid foundation
- **Section 5 (Docs)**: 3/5 - Good

See `GRADE_TRACKER.md` for detailed breakdown and roadmap.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Based on Grade Impact)

**Phase 1: Complete Core Messaging** (+15 points → 60/100)
1. Group chat implementation (Story 1.6+) - **+11 points**
2. Typing indicators - **+2 points**
3. Push notifications - **+2 points**

**Phase 2: AI Features** (+30 points → 90/100) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
1. Thread summarization
2. Action item extraction
3. Smart search
4. Priority detection
5. Decision tracking
6. Advanced AI capability (agent or proactive assistant)

### Strategy
- **Don't skip group chat** - Required for demo and 11 points
- **AI features are make-or-break** - 30 points, can't achieve target grade without them
- **Optimize for impact** - Focus on high-value features first
- **Deliverables last** - Demo video and brainlift after features work

## Active Decisions

### Grade-Focused Development
- **Prioritize by point value** - Use `GRADE_TRACKER.md` to guide feature selection
- **AI features are critical** - 30 points, must implement to reach target grade
- **Group chat required** - 11 points and needed for demo video
- **Quick wins matter** - Typing indicators (+2), diagrams (+1) for fast points

### Testing Strategy
- Use Android/iOS emulator for offline testing (not Expo Go)
- Expo Go limitations: can't test true offline mode, SQLite doesn't persist through restarts
- Test comprehensively before marking story complete
- Test all rubric acceptance criteria explicitly

### Logging Strategy
- Keep initialization logs (helpful for debugging)
- Keep network status changes
- Keep offline/sync events
- Remove repetitive cache load logs
- Always keep error logs

### Development Workflow
1. User leads with planning discussion
2. Clarify requirements before implementation
3. Implement and test thoroughly
4. Clean up and document
5. Update memory bank AND grade tracker before ending session

## Current Challenges
None - Story 1.5 is fully working and tested.

## User Preferences
- Explain approach before generating code
- Maximize planning phase clarity
- Consider complexity and ask if simpler solution preferred
- Ask clarifying questions when ambiguous
- User always runs dev server (never start automatically)
- Prefer emulator over Expo Go for full feature testing
