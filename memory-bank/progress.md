- OfflineIndicator component
- Multi-line chat input with auto-expansion
- Proper initialization sequence with state guards
- Clean logging (removed verbose, kept important)

**All 7 tests passed**:
1. SQLite initialization
2. Cache-first loading
3. Network status detection
4. Offline message queueing
5. Auto-sync on reconnect
6. Conversations cache
7. Network toggle stress test

## What's Left to Build ðŸ“‹

### Story 1.6 and Beyond
Stories 1.6+ documented in `/docs/stories/` but not yet reviewed or implemented.

### Known Planned Features
- Group messaging
- Image/media messages
- Push notifications (FCM)
- Read receipts
- Typing indicators
- User profiles
- Contact management
- Message search
- User settings

## Current Status

### Last Session Accomplishments
- Completed entire Story 1.5 implementation
- Fixed 6 critical bugs during testing
- Added multi-line input support
- Cleaned up verbose logging
- Comprehensive testing (all 7 tests passed)
- Documentation updated

### Technical Debt
None currently - Story 1.5 clean and tested.

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Review Story 1.6 requirements
2. Plan implementation approach
3. Implement and test Story 1.6
4. Update memory bank after completion

## Known Issues

### Resolved Issues
All issues from Stories 1.1-1.5 have been resolved:
- âœ… Circular dependencies fixed
- âœ… Migration API updated
- âœ… Cache sync accuracy fixed
- âœ… Network detection logic corrected
- âœ… Initialization race conditions resolved
- âœ… TypeScript configurations corrected

### Current Issues
None - app is stable and fully functional for completed stories.

### Testing Limitations (Known)
- Expo Go can't test full offline features (use emulator)
- Crash recovery testing requires production builds
- SQLite persistence in Expo Go doesn't survive restarts

## Metrics

### Code Organization
- **7 new files created** in Story 1.5
- **10 files modified** in Story 1.5
- **1 new dependency** added (netinfo)
